# Data Structures Graph Portfolio Assignment
 Python3 implementation of undirected and directed graph abstract data types stored using an adjacency matrix or adjacency list with various algorithms such as depth-first-search, breadth-first-search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. This project was completed winter quarter 2021 at OSU's CS 261 Data Structures course under the instruction of Professor Tim Alcon.
