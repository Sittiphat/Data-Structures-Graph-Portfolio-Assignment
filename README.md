# Data Structures Graph Portfolio Assignment
Python3 implementation of undirected and directed graph abstract data types stored using an adjacency matrix or adjacency list with various algorithms such as depth-first-search, breadth-first-search, and Dijkstra's algorithm. This project was completed during winter quarter 2021 at OSU's CS 261 Data Structures course under the instruction of Professor Tim Alcon.

Various test cases are already provided in both files. Simply run:
```
$ ./d_graph.py
```
or
```
$ ./ud_graph.py
```
